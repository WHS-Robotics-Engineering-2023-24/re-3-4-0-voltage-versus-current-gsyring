I created two very simple circuits that involved one LED, one 100 Ohm resistor. The only difference between the two circuits was the voltage of the power-source, which was 5, and 500. In the 500 volt power source, almost everything was changed, often by a few orders of magnitude. Everything that was onmmce a milli became a normal unit, everything that was once a normal unit became a hecto version, so on so forth.
